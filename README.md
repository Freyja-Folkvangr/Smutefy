# Smutefy

Smutefy is a small menu bar application that automatically detects and mute Spotify ads.

## How works

Spotify uses growl to show a notification when a song changes. Smutefy uses growl log to detect ads and automatically changes the audio interface to mute the ad.

## Current status

Smutefy only works in Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6
